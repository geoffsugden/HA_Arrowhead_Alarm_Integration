I'm hacking together an integration between my Alarm and Home Assistant. This is mostly for learning code. 

If you're wanting a more proffesional integration have a look at https://github.com/thanoskas/arrowhead_alarm. 

I have an ECi panel and a serial module for it. Connected using a Serial Device Server USR-TCP232-302.
